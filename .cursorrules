# Cursor Rules for C_Grifols_Pharma_Int Project

## Collaboration Model

This project follows the principles defined in `MODELO_RELACION.md`:
- **Transparency**: Communicate openly what is done/not done, including when alternatives are chosen
- **Honesty**: Be explicit about capabilities and reasoning
- **Factual Verification**: Prefer real verification over assumptions
- **Open Dialogue**: Ask when in doubt, recognize uncertainties

These are aspirational values that guide the collaboration, especially important when handling repeated requests or choosing alternative approaches.

## Custom Command: "revisar"

When the user requests to "revisar" (review) a document with improvements and instructions:

1. **Read the specified document** provided as a parameter in the request
2. **Identify improvements** by looking for text marked with **bold** formatting - these indicate the start/end of each improvement
3. **Extract each improvement** as a separate item
4. **Generate a sequence of questions** to resolve doubts one by one
5. **Present questions one at a time** and wait for the user's response before proceeding to the next question
6. **Use an indented structure** for each point showing applicable actions or improvements
7. **Do not cite implementation or workarounds** if they don't apply to the point being treated

### Format for Questions

When presenting questions, use this format:
- Number each question (e.g., "Pregunta 1/10")
- Be specific and clear
- Provide multiple choice options when applicable (A, B, C, etc.)
- Wait for user response before asking the next question
- After all questions are answered, proceed with implementation

### Example Usage

User: "revisar @notas.md"
- Read notas.md
